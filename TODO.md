TODO


Ideas:
- Several game modes
  - Journey to "GOAT" (eg: first pick, lots of potential)
  - Role-player (eg: starting as a middling prospect)
  - How far can you get from undrafted?
- Archtypes
  - Can choose from a default - this gives you default skills
  - But can also form your own by selecting for specific skills
- Skill system
  - Some combination of having points to allocate - like many RPGs, and
    also some dice rolling. Notably, I want to introduce some skill into
    the dice rolling, by allowing you to eg: stack dice rolls, or to
    save dice rolls for different situations
- Season actions
  - players will accumulate action capital (think mana), which will enable them
    to take certain actions, or allocate to leveling up and increasing their skills.

High Level:
- Simulatation System
  - Game
  - Season
- Player Generation System
  - Dice Roll System
  - Skill System
- Command Line Interface
- GUI



Now:
- Create Team Schema
- Add 30 Teams (hardcoded names)
- Determine ranking distribution (eg: 60 is all-star, 70 is all-nba, 80 is MVP, 90 is goat, 100 is goat++)
- Add more player skills
- Function to calculate an overall ranking
- Function to create a team of players, given a target overall ranking (maybe a few other params)
- Function to calculate a team ranking
- Basic function to simulate a game
-
